# Spam Detection With Comparative Text Classification  

This project explores spam detection using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The objective is to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of a traditional statistical model (TF-IDF + Naive Bayes) and a modern deep learning model (Word2Vec + LSTM) for SMS spam detection. 

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Preprocessing of text data for NLP tasks.
- Implementation of comparative text classification models.
- Effective feature engineering for spam detection.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Detailed visualization of results.
